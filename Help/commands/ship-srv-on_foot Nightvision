-- Ship/SRV/On-foot Nightvision, command: Night vision [; on; off; pulls]
-- pulls = off (voice detection)

## VoiceAttack Plugins:
## EDbind: key-variables for Ship/SRV lights
## EDDI: {TXT:Status vehicle} , {TXT:Environment} , {BOOL:Status night vision}

# This command checks the current nightvision status with EDDI variables and uses EDbinds plugin (variablekeybinds) to press the keys.
# You can either toggle 'nightvision' or say 'nightvision off/on/twice/full-beam', from any mode it goes to the spoken command.

- Ship & SRV: 'Nightvision' toggles the next status, 'On/Off' nightvision goes to that status.
- Ship & SRV: If the status is allready 'On', 'Off' or at 'Full Beam' it does nothing.
