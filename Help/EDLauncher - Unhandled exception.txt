Launcher error message: `'Unhandled exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object'`

Issue: 
```launcher gets a 'Unhandled exception: Object reference not set to an instance of an object' whenever the ED sign in screen opens.
It then closes the window and I can't play the game.```
Solution:
```This is often related to .NET I'm afraid. You should be able to circumvent the issue by running through the following:

Find a file named EDLaunch.exe.config in: C:\Program Files (x86)\Frontier\EDLaunch\
For Steam installs, it should be here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Elite Dangerous\

Firstly, make a backup of this file by copying it to another location
Open the EDLaunch.exe.config file with a text editor such as Notepad. 
You'll see something similar to:

<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727"/ >
<supportedRuntime version="v4.0"/ >

Switch the lines, so they look like this:

<supportedRuntime version="v4.0"/ >
<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727"/ >

Once you have done this, save the file and attempt to start up the launcher. 
If it's still not working you can just replace the file with the backup you created.```
