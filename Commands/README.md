## E:D 3.7 [Ship_SRV functions]+
#### [Lights; Full Beam] [; on; of; off; pulls; twice]
*About the first command I made*  
*- EDDI: {TXT:Status vehicle} , {TXT:Environment} , {BOOL:Status lights on} - Global command variables: {BOOL:full beam}*  
  
Ship/SRV lights, command checks the current lights status. 
If the lights are allready 'On', 'Off' or at 'Full Beam' it does nothing.  
'Lights' toggles the next light status, 'On/Off' lights does go to that status.  
Full-Beam / Lights twice it goes to to the Full-Beam only in the SRV.  
#### Deploy SRV / Board Ship
Deploys SRV / Board ship requires the 'SRV Handbrake' is enabled.
