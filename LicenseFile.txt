# VA App BindED - Monkey license
bindED Source Code License - Please read carefully

March 7, 2018

bindED could have been written by monkeys, so, it's safe to say there's
not much to protect here, so, have at it.

In other words, this is public domain with no strings attached -- Go for it!

# VA App EDDI - Apache 2.0
EDDN - By default this app transmits in-game location data to the Elite Dangerous Data Network ("EDDN") (https://github.com/EDSM-NET/EDDN/wiki). This network allows third party services to build databases with details about the locations you can visit in the game. Your in-game “Cmdr” name and identifying details are not shared.
EDSM - If you have registered with the Elite Dangerous Star Map (“EDSM”) (https://www.edsm.net/) website and provide this app with appropriate credentials from this service, this app can transmit your Commander details to EDSM. You can control how much of this information is visible to other people via your EDSM website settings (https://www.edsm.net/settings/public-profile).
Coriolis / EDShipyard - If you choose to export your ship loadout data to a third party service like Coriolis or EDShipyard, the app will transmit ship loadout and livery data. Personally identifiable information like your in-game “Cmdr” name, in-game location, etc. will not be transferred.
Inara - If you have registered with the Inara website (https://inara.cz) and provide this app with appropriate credentials from this service, this app can transmit your Commander details to the Inara website. You can control how much of this information is visible to other people via your Inara website settings (https://inara.cz/settings/).
VoiceAttack - If you are running the app as a plugin for VoiceAttack, this app will register appropriate variables in the VoiceAttack app which may include your Commander details. These variables are not persistent / stored between sessions of the VoiceAttack app.
