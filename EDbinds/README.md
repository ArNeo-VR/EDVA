# [EDVA](https://github.com/ArNeo-VR/EDVA) - EDbinds / keybindings ingame

In this folder a picture of the keyboard map and Logitech X56 layout.
De mode switch on the throttle I don't have a function for it yet, most is done by VA (VoiceAttack).

In VA I've assigned the joysticks to: ( in VA goto Options > General > [Joystick Options] )  
1. Logitech X-56 Joystick  
2. Logitech X-56 Throttle  
3. Thrustmaster Pendular-rudder  

The Logitech HOTAS Software not used for binding buttons to a (keyboard) keys.  
The only is the firebutton and sidebutton on the joystick are bound to the mouse 1/2.
