# [EDVA](https://github.com/ArNeo-VR/EDVA) - EDbinds / keybindings ingame

In this folder a picture of the keyboard map and Logitech X56 layout.
De mode switch on the throttle I don't have a function for it yet, most is done by VA (VoiceAttack).

In VA I've assigned the joysticks to: ( in VA goto Options > General > [Joystick Options] )  
1. Logitech X-56 Joystick  
2. Logitech X-56 Throttle  
3. Thrustmaster Pendular-rudder  


## The Logitech HOTAS Software 
Is not used for binding buttons to a (keyboard) keys.  


### On the joystick
- Firebutton and sidebutton are bound to the mouse 1/2  

### Settings on the X-56 Joystick  
X-Axis: Curve profile:S Deadband:0 Curvature:660 X-SAT:1000 Y-SAT:1000  
Y-Axis: Curve profile:S Deadband:0 Curvature:665 X-SAT:1000 Y-SAT:1000  
Rudder: Curve profile:S Deadband:153 Curvature:149 X-SAT:0 Y-SAT:1000 (I don't use this)  


### On the throttle  
- Most are set to Unprogrammed  
- Hat 3/4 are set to 4-way, fallback  
- The throttle has two seperate parts, I've bound them to the Ship/SRV (Right/Left)

- Slide-button, I use it to mute Teamspeak
