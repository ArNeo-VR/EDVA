# [EDVA](https://github.com/ArNeo-VR/EDVA#edva) - EDbinds / keybindings ingame

In this folder a picture of the keyboard map and Logitech X56 layout.  
The mode switch on the throttle I don't have a function for it yet, 
most is done by VA (VoiceAttack) haven't found a way to use the mode select in VA.  

In VA I've assigned the joysticks to: ( in VA goto Options > General > [Joystick Options] )  
1. Logitech X-56 Joystick  
2. Logitech X-56 Throttle  
3. Thrustmaster Pendular-rudder  


## The Logitech HOTAS Software
Is not used for binding buttons to a (keyboard) keys.  
- Most are set to Unprogrammed  
*Dunno the difference between Unprogrammed and fallback .. guess RTFM*
