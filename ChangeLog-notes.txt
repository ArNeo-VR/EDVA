-- IMO Vivo Pro 2
Gets pretty hot on the top front.
Controllers suck
Grabbing the button on the side is not good, sometimes grabbing the front camera with it to get a grip.
Dunno if its steam or vive, the in VR screen text is hardly readable

-- notes
? Landing gear, environment check ?
Some command rely on a custom bool variable "Hangar" this is not supplied by EDDI.
It gets set when you use the 'Enter hangar/Return to surface' command, or manualy 'set hangar true;false'
